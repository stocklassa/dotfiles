## dotfiles

* The dotfiles I'm currently working on
* I want to create a uniform cross-platform development environment for myself


### TODOs

* go over vim plugins
* revisit the vim compile commands to not be ancient
* put scripts into own folder?
* do a decent setup on my main machine with soft links and put that into a script... or maybe use stow?
